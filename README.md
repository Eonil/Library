Eonil Library

This is brave trial to make a monolith repository for all of
my reusable code.

This source tree cares only one thing. Version consistency. 
This doesn't care anything else. Total size of this source 
code would grow large as like GBs, and total build time would 
take hours...

Anyway for your convenience, each component libraries are 
currently separated in different repositories. You can 
composite them to build your own *llight-weight* version
compositions.







Note
----
Do not place any large binary. Currently I have no good idea 
how to handle those large binaries. Then, prebuilt LLDB library
has been excluded.
